THe interesting part is that the join is simple but the conditions for retaining each row are difficult.
First is a max (you need to create a temp table and then find the max of that table)
Second is remove duplicate scores unless max (


SELECT h.hacker_id, min(h.name), COUNT(c.challenge_id) as totz FROM hackers h INNER JOIN challenges c USING(hacker_id) GROUP BY h.hacker_id 
HAVING totz = (SELECT MAX(temp1.cnt)
        from (SELECT COUNT(hacker_id) as cnt
             from Challenges
             group by hacker_id
             order by hacker_id) temp1)
OR

ORDER BY totz DESC, hacker_id
