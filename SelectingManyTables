Things to note:
1. You can use SELECT to create new columns without a join. Main conditions here are
  a. Each new column will have row entries (as per the first two columns in this example) and need some linkage mechanism to identify each row (the WHERE clause)
  b. The new column will likely be an aggregate
2. DISTINCT was used because there were duplicates


Solution:

select c.company_code, c.founder,
(select count(DISTINCT lead_manager_code) from Lead_Manager where company_code=c.company_code),
(select count(DISTINCT senior_manager_code) from Senior_Manager where company_code=c.company_code),
(select count(DISTINCT manager_code) from Manager where company_code=c.company_code),
(select count(DISTINCT employee_code) from Employee where company_code=c.company_code)
from Company c order by c.company_code;
